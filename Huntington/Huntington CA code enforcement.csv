Furthermore, my self as well as other neighbors have witnessed drugs being sold and purchased as well as drug and alcohol use by the residents. There have been full on fist fights starting within the home and then continuing into the street. Third, last week the residents started a fire on the second story balcony and were only made aware of the burning by neighbors yelling within the home. Fourth, they have shot bottle rockets at my house, and when I have confronted them, they have threatened me. If the home is a drug rehab, there are multiple state health code violations. There are 8 residents there, they have no restrictions, blatant drug and alcohol use, and are a contract nuisance to the entire neighborhood.

Since the year of 2016 the landlord has been notified of water leakage and damage occurring in both bedrooms.

He has received videos, pictures, verbal notices, and personally checked the areas himself, and still continued to assume that we are dreaming stuff up. We now have visible mold in the bathroom due to a leak in the unit upstairs, and it looks to be Stachybotrys Chartarum known as black mold according to a mold remediation company. The landlord is refusing to get this fix the right way, There is also water damage in my garage and wood rut outside our patio among other serious issues? the mold is of the most concern to us at this time.
