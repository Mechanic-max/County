Third, last week the residents started a fire on the second story balcony and were only made aware of the burning by neighbors yelling within the home. Fourth, they have shot bottle rockets at my house, and when I have confronted them, they have threatened me. If the home is a drug rehab, there are multiple state health code violations.

Since the year of 2016 the landlord has been notified of water leakage and damage occurring in both bedrooms. He has ignored the request to fix these issues and asked that holes be poked on the ceiling of one of the areas to let the water pour into a bucket. He has received videos, pictures, verbal notices, and personally checked the areas himself, and still continued to assume that we are dreaming stuff up. We now have visible mold in the bathroom due to a leak in the unit upstairs, and it looks to be Stachybotrys Chartarum known as black mold according to a mold remediation company. The landlord is refusing to get this fix the right way, There is also water damage in my garage and wood rut outside our patio among other serious issues? the mold is of the most concern to us at this time. We have a ten year old and a ten month old baby living here, and would appreciate a visit by one of the code enforcement inspectors to help us address these issues. We are using our neighbors bathroom and are also all sleeping in the living room to keep our family safe for the time being. Thank you!

The problems with the neighbors house has included cars continuously parked on their lawn, the visible rotting termite infested wood, fence damage between our properties, including overgrowth of trees, roots under the fence, causing concrete foundation damage to our property. There are tires, rims, fenders, rubbish, dead leaves and bushes along their side of the fence. We now have rodents which have made their way into our rental attic causing damage and new costs. Trees are also overgrown into the power & telephone wires overhead. These issues have been costly to us, effecting our rental structure, plumbing and property value. We have documented this disturbing deterioration of the neighborï¿½s house and property since 2006. Formal complaints to code enforcement were made in 2012, 2017, 2020.
