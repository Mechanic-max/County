There are tires, rims, fenders, rubbish, dead leaves and bushes along their side of the fence. We now have rodents which have made their way into our rental attic causing damage and new costs. Trees are also overgrown into the power & telephone wires overhead. These issues have been costly to us, effecting our rental structure, plumbing and property value.
